# Interactive Brokers Kafka Integration

This project demonstrates integration with Interactive Brokers (IB) using Kafka for messaging. Below are the essential files and their purposes:

## Usage

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Kafka installed and running locally.
   - Interactive Brokers (IB) API Gateway or TWS running locally.

2. **Files to Run:**

   - **send_kafka_message.py:** Sends market orders to IB via Kafka.
   - **inspecotr_ib_order_requests.py:** Monitors and sends order requests to IB.
   - **inspecotr_ib_order_responses.py:** Listens for and displays order responses from IB.
   - **config/kafka_config.py:** Configuration file for Kafka broker and topics.

3. **Expected Outcome:**
   - **Triggering Market Orders:** Expect messages indicating successful submission of market orders to IB.
   - **Viewing Order Requests:** Expect to see details of orders sent to IB for execution.
   - **Viewing Order Responses:** Expect updates and notifications on order status changes (e.g., filled orders) from IB.

4. **Current Issues:**
   - **Issue 1:** order is sent to IB in pendingSubmit state, this is fine as its part of the state transition, 
                   but we are not receiving the subsequent messages for the fills etc.

5. **Installation:**
   - Install dependencies using pip:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

6. **Troubleshooting:**
   - If encountering issues beyond those listed above, check the following:
     - Ensure Kafka (`localhost:9092`) and IB API/TWS are running and accessible.
     - Verify configurations in `config/kafka_config.py` match your Kafka setup.
     - Review logs or error messages printed by each script for specific issues.
     - Check the Interactive Brokers API documentation for any known issues or updates.
