# Interactive Brokers Kafka Integration

This project demonstrates how to integrate with Interactive Brokers (IB) using Kafka for messaging. It includes components to send and receive market order requests via Kafka topics and receive updates on these orders.

## Configuration

- **Kafka Broker:** Configured through `config/kafka_config.py`, specifying broker URL (`localhost:9092`) and topic mappings for order requests and responses.

## Components

### Kafka Consumers

- **Order Requests Inspector (`src/kafka_inspectors/inspecotr_ib_order_requests.py`):**
  - Listens to `ib_order_requests_dev_topic` for market order requests.
  - Prints received messages from the Kafka topic.

- **Order Responses Inspector (`src/kafka_inspectors/inspecotr_ib_order_responses.py`):**
  - Listens to `ib_order_responses_dev_topic` for order updates (e.g., filled orders, status updates).
  - Prints received messages from the Kafka topic.

### Kafka Producer

- **Message Sender (`src/message_gen/send_kafka_message.py`):**
  - Sends predefined JSON messages representing market orders to `ib_order_requests_dev_topic`.
  - Demonstrates how to serialize messages and send them to Kafka.

## Expected Behavior

- **Triggering Market Orders:**
  - Messages sent to `ib_order_requests_dev_topic` trigger market orders to be sent to the IB API.

- **Receiving Order Updates:**
  - Updates from submitted orders (e.g., fills, status changes) are received via `ib_order_responses_dev_topic`.

## Rationale

- **Purpose:** This project facilitates seamless integration with Interactive Brokers' API using Kafka messaging.
- **Use Case:** By utilizing Kafka topics, the system efficiently manages order requests and updates asynchronously.
- **Flexibility:** Kafka enables scalable and reliable communication, ensuring robust handling of order lifecycle events.

## Usage

1. Ensure Kafka is running locally with the specified broker URL.
2. Run each component as needed:
   - Start Kafka consumers (`inspecotr_ib_order_requests.py` and `inspecotr_ib_order_responses.py`) to listen for messages.
   - Use `send_kafka_message.py` to send test messages (market orders) to the request topic (`ib_order_requests_dev_topic`).

## Dependencies

- `aiokafka`: Asyncio client for Kafka.
- `json`: For JSON serialization of messages.

## Notes

- Adjust Kafka configuration (`config/kafka_config.py`) as per your environment setup.
- Customize message structures and consumer behavior as per specific project requirements.
